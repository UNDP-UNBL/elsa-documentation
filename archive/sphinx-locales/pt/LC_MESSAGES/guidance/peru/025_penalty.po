"The boundary penalty factor is used to promote spatial cohesion when "
"prioritizing land use zones. The boundary penalty can be 0 or higher. The "
"higher the value, the more connected and contiguous the prioritization "
"action zones will be on the map, making it more enforceable. This adjustment "
"is based on the idea that, for real-world planning, a more connected zone is "
"usually easier to manage and execute actions."

"Increase the number iteratively, i.e., rerun the optimization repeatedly, by "
"an order of magnitude (e.g., 0.00001 -> 0.0001 -> 0.001), reducing the rate "
"of increase as you approach solutions that lead to your desired level of "
"clustering. Each time you change the penalty, you will have to rerun the "
"optimization until you arrive at a map that is sufficiently contiguous to "
"meet your needs."
