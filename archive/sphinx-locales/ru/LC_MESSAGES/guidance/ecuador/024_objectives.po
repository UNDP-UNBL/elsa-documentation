"This part of the spatial prioritization webtool to identify priority areas "
"to support the implementation of the GBF allows you to set area-based "
"targets for protection, restoration, and management. Targets can also be "
"understood as the percentage of land area that can be allocated to each "
"action within the country. The default values in the Prioritizing Nature "
"webtool are derived from the targets in the GBF in Ecuador (see Table 1)."
