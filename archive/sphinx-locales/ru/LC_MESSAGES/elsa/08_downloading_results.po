"After running an ELSA analysis, you can view the final action map associated "
"with that version of the analysis by toggling the analysis run in the left "
"tab. The resulting ‘ELSA Action’ layer that shows up on the map by default "
"is the final action map which shows priority areas for protection, "
"restoration, management and/or urban greening actions in your country that "
"can best contribute to outcomes for KMGBF Targets 1-12. Similar to the "
"heatmaps, users can zoom in to specific areas using the UNBL interface and "
"toggle satellite imagery as well as other layers available in the workspace/"
"UNBL public platform to evaluate the final results."
