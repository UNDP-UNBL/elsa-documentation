"A formal method for identifying potential areas for conservation management "

"some minimum representation of biodiversity. The process involves a clear "
"and structured approach to priority setting, and is now the norm for both "
"terrestrial and marine conservation. The effectiveness of systematic "
"conservation planning lies in its ability to make the best use of limited "
"fiscal resources to achieve conservation objectives and to do so in a way "
