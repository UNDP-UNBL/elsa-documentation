"To carry out the optimization analysis, stakeholders have to decide the "
"comparative importance of each of the planning features that outline the "
"priority ENDB targets for Ecuador. This is achieved through weighting. For "
"example, if biological corridors that help connect protected areas and "
"crucial wildlife habitats are considered to be of high importance, this "
"planning feature should be given greater weight (>3)."
