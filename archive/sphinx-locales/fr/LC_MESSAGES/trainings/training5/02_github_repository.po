"The multiple permutations of the *ELSA*, *Protecting Nature*, and related "
"webtools are manged as separate branches (think of branches as subtle "
"offshoots of a main project, where there are main commonalities but subtle "
"and smaller differences) of a single version controlled git repository "
"hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_. You may or may not be familiar "
"with git (or other version control software) but, as the term implies, git "
"is a control system thats tracks changes in code, documents, etc., and "
"allows multiple people to collaborate, add new functionality, merge, and "
"revert changes efficiently, all while maintaining a history of modifications "
"that prevents conflicts and enables rollback to previous states if needed. "
"This setup allows for a simplified management and development of shared "
"functionality between tools, but still allow for bespoke development of "
"tools specific to a project and country's individual needs (ranging from "
"tailored language/translations differences to data input specifications)."
