"Broadly speaking, on Windows systems, you need only double-click on the "
"*Gurobi* installer, follow the prompts, and the installer will automatically "
"handle everything for you (using default settings). On Linux and MacOS "
"systems, you will need to manually extract the downloaded file’s contents to "
"a folder, move the extracted contents to a suitable location (typically ``/"
"opt/gurobi``), and update your system’s variables so that it knows where to "
"find *Gurobi* (i.e., the PATH variable). See OS specific instructions below "
