"*R* is not a program like Microsoft Word or Google Chrome that a user simply "
"opens and starts doing some work with. Rather, *R* is a computer language, "
"much like *C++*, *Python*, or *Java Script*, etc., whereby commands (in the "
"*R* language in our case) are passed to the operating system, which in turn "
"is able to interpret them (using an interpreter) and provide responses (this "
"can be as simple as adding ``2 + 2`` or as complex as sending queries to "
"your favourite AI chat bot asking where the nearest phá»Ÿ restaurant is to eat "
"at tonight). There are various front-end coding environments (called IDEs, "
"or Integrated Development Environments) which can be used to interact with "
"*R*, but the most common *R* IDE is a program developed by `Posit <https://"
"posit.co/>`_ called *RStudio* - *RStudio* will be used in all the "
"Prioritizing Nature project training series."
