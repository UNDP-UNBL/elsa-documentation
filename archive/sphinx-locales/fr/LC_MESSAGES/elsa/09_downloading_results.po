"After running an ELSA analysis, users can view the final ELSA Action map "
"associated with that version of the analysis by toggling the analysis run in "
"the left tab. The resulting *ELSA Action* layer which shows up on the map by "
"default is the final action map which shows priority areas for protection, "
"restoration, management and/or urban greening actions in the country. "
"Similar to the heatmaps, users can zoom in to specific areas using the UNBL "
"interface and toggle satellite imagery as well as other layers available in "
"the workspace/UNBL public platform to evaluate final results."
