The ELSA Tool does not require any coding or modelling skills and is easy to use for people who are not spatial data experts. </p> <p>This free, open-source, cloud-hosted tool provides stakeholders in all countries with a science-based methodology to identify national priority areas where protection, restoration, management, and urban greening can lead to the best outcomes across the KMGBF targets and indicators. By leveraging global datasets and advanced scenario modeling, the ELSA Tool allows users to adjust priorities, set constraints, and revisit their plans to ensure critical areas are adequately protected or restored while addressing economic and societal needs. The resulting spatial prioritization map can directly support the implementation of KMGBF Targets 1, 2, and 3, with co-benefits for Targets 4-12.

They can: </p> <pre><code>- Display input layers (also known as planning features)used to map KMGBF targets.\n- Create and execute new ELSA analysis runs with different stakeholder groups. Users can modify and edit ELSA analysis runs in the following ways:  \n  - Modify the percentage of national territory allocated for each nature-based action zone including protection (KMGBF Target 3), restoration (KMGBF Target 2), management (KMGBF Target 10), and/or urban greening (KMGBF Target 12). These configurations can be adapted to the country's policy targets for conservation, restoration, and protection, among others; \n  - Choose whether to lock-in existing Protected Areas for protection, ensuring existing Protected Areas are selected within the solution map; \n  - Edit weights of each of the input layers (planning features) based on national importance of the mapped feature and confidence in the input data; and \n  - Edit the boundary penalty factor parameter to adjust spatial cohesion of the action map.\n- View and download resulting heat maps and action maps. \n- Download resulting heat maps and action maps in raster format, which can be used for further analysis according to the needs of the interested parties in desktop Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software. \n- Download results and parameters of an existing ELSA analysis run as a summary table, which is available in .xlsx, .csv and .json formats.\n</code></pre> <p>The ELSA Tool cannot be used to: </p> <ul> <li>Add additional data layers for inclusion either as planning features or as zoning constraints.  </li> <li>Directly replace input layers with other input layers.  </li> <li>Add additional lock-in features. </li> </ul> <p>These modifications, as well as further custom analysis development to meet national needs, are available on a cost recovery basis from the UNBL team. To learn more and explore options, please contact support@unbiodiversitylab.org.  </p> <p>The ELSA Tool uses the prioritizr package in the back end as a spatial optimization tool to run an ELSA analysis. prioritizr supports a broad range of objectives, constraints and penalties to create a tailored analysis. Optimizations can be executed quickly on UNBL (often within 3-5 minutes). It can therefore be used to generate and refine conservation plans in real-time during stakeholder meetings, and contribute to a more transparent, inclusive, and participatory decision-making process to identify priority areas to support the implementation of KMGBF Targets 1, 2 and 3, with powerful co-benefits for Targets 4-12.  </p> <p>Note</p> <p>Definitions of technical terminology mentioned in the guidance can be found in :ref:<code>Annex 1 &lt;annex-1&gt;</code>. </p> <p></p> <p>Figure 1.

Zones are determined by restrictions that define where an action may or may not absolutely occur. For example, these hard restrictions limit protection to intact areas (e.g., low human footprint values) and protection/restoration to areas that are moderately impacted by human activity, but not totally dominated by humans (e.g., low and medium human footprint values). </p> <p>Area-based constraint       The maximum area (expressed as a percentage of the total area of the country) that can be assigned to a specific action zone (protection, restoration, management, or urban greening).</p> <p>Boundary Penalty Factor (BPF)       Solutions are penalized based on the total outer boundary or edge of the zones. By penalizing solutions with large edge length, this BPF can be used to promote spatial cohesion or clustering in the spatial prioritization zones of priority areas for KMGBF implementation. </p> <p>Decision support software       A computer application that uses information about possible actions and the limitations of those actions to assist the decision-making process in achieving a stated objective. </p> <p>Geographic Information System (GIS)       Computer system consisting of hardware and software necessary for the capture, storage, management, analysis and presentation of geographic (spatial) data. </p> <p>Lock-in Features       Specific features or areas that are locked-in to a solution. Typically, this would refer to existing protected areas, that are by default locked into an SCP problem creation.  </p> <p>Planning feature       A spatial dataset used to map spatial elements of KMGBF Targets 1-12. Each KMGBF target may be mapped by one or more planning features depending on its complexity. Planning features may include ecological classifications, habitat types, species, physical objects, processes, or any element that can be measured in a planning unit.</p> <p>Planning units       Planning units are the basic elements of prioritization analysis. A study area is divided into planning units that are smaller geographic parcels of regular or irregular shapes. Examples are squares, hexagons, cadastral parcels and hydrological units. </p> <p>Representation       In Systematic Conservation Planning, a representative system captures the full range of planning features (species, ecosystems, and ecosystem services) occurring in the planning region, not just iconic species. </p> <p>Restrictions       A constraint that must be met during optimization. The main constraints are that the area-based constraint (land area devoted to each action) is not exceeded and that each zone can only occur within specified planning units (e.g. the protection zone can only be possible in planning units that are not agricultural or urban coverage).</p> <p>Systematic Conservation Planning (SCP)       A formal method for identifying potential areas for conservation management that will most efficiently achieve a specific set of objectives, commonly some minimum representation of biodiversity. The process involves a clear and structured approach to priority setting, and is now the norm for both terrestrial and marine conservation. The effectiveness of systematic conservation planning lies in its ability to make the best use of limited fiscal resources to achieve conservation objectives and to do so in a way that is defensible, accountable, and transparently recognizes the needs of different resource users. </p> <p>User interface       The means by which people interact with a given computer application. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) presents information in a simple way using graphics, menus and icons.</p> <p>Weights       The weights allow users to set relative priorities across planning features.

In this regard, GBF Target 3 , also known as the 30x30 Target aims to conserve 30% of terrestrial areas, inland waters and seas by 2030. In addition to this high-level quantitative goal, the target includes qualitative elements, such as \"ecologically representative, well-connected and equitably governed\" systems. The target also mentions various conservation approaches, including protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures (OECM), as well as recognition and respect for the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities. For this target, the use of geospatial data is extremely relevant for identifying conservation areas, as well as for monitoring and reporting on the impacts of various types of conservation schemes.</p>"},{"location":"guidance/ecuador/01_intro/#spatial-prioritization-mapping-in-support-of-the-gbf-goals","title":"Spatial prioritization mapping in support of the GBF goals","text":"<p>UNDP, through a partnership with Ecuador and the United Nations Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC), implemented the Prioritizing Nature project to support the national use of spatial data to achieve GBF Target 3 and the equivalent target at the national level. The project built on previous collaborations using innovative tools such as the UN Biodiversity Lab  (UNBL) and effective methodologies such as the Maps of Hope  in which countries identify ELSAs where nature protection, management and restoration measures can best contribute to the achievement of various national priority policy objectives in biodiversity, climate and sustainable development. </p> <p>The project mobilized key national stakeholders and experts to carry out a series of scientific activities to develop a spatial prioritization map that supports the goals of the GBF. In Ecuador, work was carried out with national partners, in particular the Ministry of Environment, Water and Ecological Transition (MAATE), to support the country to identify and assess potential conservation areas based on existing land governance and management, improve network connectivity and support the achievement of national environmental and socio-economic priorities; this led to supporting the government to propose ways of protection to meet the 30x30 Target in Ecuador.</p> <p>To develop the spatial prioritization map, Systematic Conservation Planning (SCP) was used to analyze land use zones and outcomes. SCP is used to optimize spatially explicit conservation actions to promote the persistence of biodiversity and other natural features in situ. SCP involves a transparent and objective process of setting clear goals and objectives, and then planning conservation actions that meet them. The  spatial prioritization mapping process was developed to directly support the spatial elements of the GBF targets. This includes Goals 1-3, which set goals around spatial planning, sustainable management, ecosystem restoration, and protection through protected areas and OECMs. Other spatial elements were also drawn from GBF Targets 4-12, which cover threatened species, climate change and a range of ecosystem services. The project has helped Ecuador to:</p> <ul> <li>Jointly develop a spatial prioritization map that demonstrates a pathway to achieve GBF Target 3, while supporting the other targets of the GBF;</li> <li>Assess potential OECMs to support the government in identifying priority areas for site-level assessments; and</li> <li>Assess the condition within existing protected areas, OECMs and ecological corridors.</li> </ul> <p>..

Thankfully Gurobi provides detailed platform-specific instructions  for Windows, MacOS, and Linux systems that should help with this. </p> <p>Broadly speaking, on Windows systems, you need only double-click on the Gurobi installer, follow the prompts, and the installer will automatically handle everything for you (using default settings). On Linux and MacOS systems, you will need to manually extract the downloaded file\u2019s contents to a folder, move the extracted contents to a suitable location (typically [/opt/gurobi`), and update your system\u2019s variables so that it knows where to find Gurobi (i.e., the PATH variable). See OS specific instructions below for more details.</p> <p>After installing the Gurobi software suite on your computer, you will need to activate your license.</p> <p>Important</p> <p>Gurobi is a commercial and proprietary computer program. This means that is will not work without a valid license - downloading the software is also not possible without being registered with Gurobi. </p> <p>We provide a short term usage of our cloud license for the Prioritizing Nature Trainings, only.

These do have default values that are set when you start the webtool. Starting with the top-most parameter, these are:</p> <ul> <li>A tickbox option to specify whether you want to run either a single prioritisation or multiple prioritisations (one for each data theme that exists). This defaults to running a single prioritisation (the box is unticked). In the Spanish language version of the tool this shows as:</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li> <p>A dropdown menu allowing you to select how you would like to deal with potential OECM and degraded areas within existing Protected Areas. There are four (4) options:</p> <p>1) Lock-in nothing; 2) Lock-in potential OECM areas (for protection); 3) Lock-in degraded areas within existing protected areas (for restoration); 4) Lock-in potential OECM area (for protection) and degraded areas within existing protected area (for restoration)</p> <p>In the the webtools it will appear like the image below:</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Protect, Restore, and Manage budgets. Budgets are in percentages (%) and are the maximum area of a country that  could be spatially allocated to particular action. </p> <p>Note</p> <p>As noted in the tool, these values cannot be smaller than the minimum area (again, as a %) that is already locked in to an action based on your lock-in selection above. </p> <pre><code>![layout_3.png](images/layout_3.png)\n\nFor example, the image below (in Ecuador), if you select to lock-in OECMs (either OECMs by themselves or OECMs and degraded areas within existing protected areas), the minimum budget value for protect increases greatly. In simple terms, if OCEMs are locked-in to a  solution (in Ecuador), a minimum of 63.07% of the country is allocated to the Protect action (you can increase the budget higher, but not lower it).\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Boundary Length Penalty Factor.
