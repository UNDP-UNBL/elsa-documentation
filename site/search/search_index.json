The ELSA Tool does not require any coding or modelling skills and is easy to use for people who are not spatial data experts. </p> <p>This free, open-source, cloud-hosted tool provides stakeholders in all countries with a science-based methodology to identify national priority areas where protection, restoration, management, and urban greening can lead to the best outcomes across the KMGBF targets and indicators. By leveraging global datasets and advanced scenario modeling, the ELSA Tool allows users to adjust priorities, set constraints, and revisit their plans to ensure critical areas are adequately protected or restored while addressing economic and societal needs. The resulting spatial prioritization map can directly support the implementation of KMGBF Targets 1, 2, and 3, with co-benefits for Targets 4-12.
