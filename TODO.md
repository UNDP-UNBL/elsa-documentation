## üîÑ In Progress / Recommended Next Steps

### High Priority

- [ ] **Review converted Markdown files** - Check that complex RST directives converted correctly
- [ ] **Fix external links** - Update `www.7-zip.org` link in training5/05_installing_gurobi.md to include `https://`
- [ ] **Test all internal links** - Verify cross-references between pages work
- [ ] **Review images** - Ensure all images display correctly and paths are correct

### Medium Priority

- [ ] **Complete translations** - Migrate content from .po files to .lang.md files
  - Option A: Run `python3 setup_i18n.py` to create placeholders
  - Option B: Use translation management platform (Crowdin, Transifex)
  - Option C: Manual extraction from .po files
- [ ] **Add missing index files** - Create comprehensive index.md files for subsections
- [ ] **Update custom CSS** - Review and update `docs/assets/css/elsa-custom.css` for Material theme
- [ ] **Add logo and favicon** - Update paths in mkdocs.yml if you have logo files

### Low Priority

- [ ] **Add social cards** - Configure Material theme's social cards feature
- [ ] **Set up versioning** - Use mike for documentation versioning if needed
- [ ] **Add analytics** - Configure Google Analytics or privacy-friendly alternative
- [ ] **Improve SEO** - Add meta descriptions to pages
- [ ] **Add search configuration** - Fine-tune search behavior if needed
- [ ] **Create custom 404 page** - Add docs/404.md for better error handling

## üìã Testing Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Build succeeds without errors: `mkdocs build --strict`
- [ ] Local preview works: `mkdocs serve`
- [ ] Test all major pages load correctly
- [ ] Test navigation between sections
- [ ] Test language switcher
- [ ] Test search functionality
- [ ] Test on mobile/tablet devices
- [ ] Test images and diagrams display
- [ ] Test code blocks and syntax highlighting
- [ ] Test admonitions (notes, warnings, etc.)
- [ ] Verify ReadTheDocs build succeeds
- [ ] Test deployed site on ReadTheDocs URL

## üêõ Known Issues

### Minor Warnings (Non-blocking)

1. **Link warning**: `trainings/training5/05_installing_gurobi.md` contains link to `www.7-zip.org` without protocol
   - **Fix**: Add `https://` to the link

### Navigation Improvements Needed

1. Some Ecuador/Peru guidance subsections not in nav (files exist but not linked)
   - Files: `021_what.md`, `022_functions.md`, `023_lock.md`, etc.
   - **Decision needed**: Should these be separate nav items or included in parent pages?

## üöÄ Deployment Plan

1. **Staging**: Test on a branch/fork
2. **Review**: Team reviews the new MkDocs site
3. **Parallel run**: Keep Sphinx running while testing MkDocs
4. **Switch**: Update main branch and ReadTheDocs points to MkDocs
5. **Monitor**: Watch for any issues in first week
6. **Cleanup**: Remove old Sphinx files after successful migration (optional)

## üí° Tips

- Keep the Sphinx files for now as backup
