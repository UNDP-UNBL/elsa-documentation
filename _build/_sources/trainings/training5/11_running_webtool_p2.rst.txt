Running the *Prioritizing Nature Webtool*
=========================================

If ``pre_run.R`` completed successfully, you should now be able to run the *Protecting Nature Webtool* locally on your computer.

We can do so several ways:

    1) Typing **Ctrl+Alt+Enter** inside the editor panel with any of ``server.R``, ``global.R``, ``ui.R``, or ``start.R`` open. In all cases this is the same as running in the console:

    .. code-block:: r

        source('start.R')

    2) Or clicking on the |pre_run1| button in the upper right side of the editor panel with any of ``server.R``, ``global.R``, ``ui.R``, or ``start.R`` open.

.. |pre_run1| image:: images/pre_run1.png

By default, RStudio will open in the *Rshiny* *Prioritizing Nature Webtool* in your default web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.). It should look like the image below (which shows the Ecuador version of the tool in Spanish)
