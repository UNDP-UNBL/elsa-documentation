# üöÄ Ready to Deploy!

Your ELSA documentation is now fully configured and ready to deploy to GitHub Pages.

## ‚úÖ What's Complete

- [x] Converted all 72 RST files to Markdown
- [x] Set up MkDocs with Material theme
- [x] Configured multi-language support (5 languages)
- [x] Created GitHub Actions workflow for auto-deployment
- [x] Updated to GitHub Pages URLs
- [x] Removed old Sphinx files
- [x] Organized project structure
- [x] Created comprehensive documentation
- [x] Tested local builds (3.64 seconds)

## üéØ Next Steps

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages (One-Time Setup)

Go to: https://github.com/UNDP-UNBL/elsa-documentation/settings/pages

Configure:
- **Source**: Deploy from a branch
- **Branch**: `gh-pages`
- **Folder**: `/ (root)`

Click **Save**

### 2. Deploy to GitHub

```bash
# Review all changes
git status

# Add everything
git add .

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Migrate from Sphinx to MkDocs with GitHub Pages deployment"

# Push to main branch
git push origin main
```

### 3. Monitor Deployment

Watch the build: https://github.com/UNDP-UNBL/elsa-documentation/actions

- Wait for green checkmark ‚úÖ (2-3 minutes)
- First deployment may take 5-10 minutes

### 4. Visit Your Site

https://undp-unbl.github.io/elsa-documentation/

## üåê When Ready for Custom Domain

Later, when DNS is ready, follow: [CUSTOM_DOMAIN_SETUP.md](CUSTOM_DOMAIN_SETUP.md)

Quick steps:
1. Create `docs/CNAME` file with `docs.unbiodiversitylab.org`
2. Update `site_url` in `mkdocs.yml`
3. Configure DNS (CNAME to undp-unbl.github.io)
4. Add custom domain in GitHub settings
5. Wait for DNS propagation + SSL certificate

### Features
- Modern, mobile-responsive design
- 5 languages (EN, ES, FR, PT, RU)
- Dark/light mode toggle
- Fast client-side search
- Image lightbox
- Code copy buttons
- Automatic deployment

### Performance
- Build time: ~3-4 seconds locally

git commit -m "Update overview section"
git push origin main

# Site rebuilds automatically!
```

## üìû Need Help?

1. Check the documentation guides above

3. Test locally first: `mkdocs serve`
4. Check [GitHub Pages docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)

## üéâ Summary

Everything is configured and ready. Just:

1. **Enable GitHub Pages** in repository settings
2. **Push to main** branch
3. **Wait 2-3 minutes**
4. **Visit your site!**
