# File Purposes - Quick Reference

This document explains what each configuration file is for and whether you need it.

## ‚úÖ Files You Need

### Documentation Content
- **`docs/`** - All your Markdown documentation files
  - Keep and edit as needed

### MkDocs Configuration
- **`mkdocs.yml`** - Main MkDocs configuration
  - Defines site structure, theme, plugins, navigation
  - Edit when adding pages or changing settings

### Python Dependencies
- **`requirements.txt`** - Python packages for GitHub Actions
  - Used by GitHub Actions to build the site in the cloud
  - **DO NOT DELETE** - GitHub Actions needs this!

- **`environment-mkdocs.yaml`** - Conda/mamba environment for local development
  - Used on your local machine with conda/mamba
  - Makes local development easier
  - Can be deleted if you only use pip/venv

### GitHub Actions
- **`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`** - Automatic deployment workflow
  - Triggers on every push to main
  - Builds and deploys site to GitHub Pages
  - Uses `requirements.txt` to install packages

### Custom Domain (Future)
- **`docs/CNAME`** - Will contain your custom domain
  - Create this when setting up docs.unbiodiversitylab.org
  - Not needed yet

## üìö Documentation Files

- **`README.md`** - Original project README (can update or replace)
- **`README-MKDOCS.md`** - MkDocs-specific README
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** - Version history (keep updated)
- **`QUICKSTART.md`** - Quick start guide
- **`MKDOCS_MIGRATION.md`** - Migration documentation
- **`GITHUB_PAGES_SETUP.md`** - GitHub Pages setup guide
- **`CUSTOM_DOMAIN_SETUP.md`** - Custom domain instructions
- **`DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md`** - Deployment overview
- **`CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md`** - Cleanup documentation
- **`TODO.md`** - Task tracking
- **`FILE_PURPOSES.md`** - This file

## üóÇÔ∏è Supporting Directories

- **`scripts/`** - Conversion utilities (for reference)
  - `convert_rst_to_md.py` - RST to Markdown converter
  - `setup_i18n.py` - Translation setup helper
  - Can be deleted if you don't need to re-run conversions

- **`archive/`** - Old Sphinx translation files
  - `sphinx-locales/` - Original .po translation files
  - Keep for reference when doing translations
  - Can be deleted once translations are complete

- **`site/`** - Built website (generated)
  - Auto-generated by `mkdocs build`
  - Not committed to git (in .gitignore)
  - Can be deleted anytime - rebuilds automatically

- **`.github/`** - GitHub-specific files
  - `workflows/` - GitHub Actions workflows
  - Keep this directory

## ‚ùå Files Deleted

These were removed during cleanup:
- ~~`.readthedocs.yaml.disabled`~~ - No longer needed ‚úÖ Deleted
- ~~`docs/conf.py`~~ - Old Sphinx config
- ~~`docs/Makefile`~~ - Old Sphinx build file
- ~~`docs/make.bat`~~ - Old Windows build script
- ~~`environment.yaml`~~ - Old Sphinx environment
- ~~All .rst files~~ - Converted to .md

## üîÑ Workflow Comparison

### Local Development (Your Computer)
```
Uses: environment-mkdocs.yaml
Process:
  1. mamba activate elsa-mkdocs
  2. mkdocs serve (for preview)
  3. mkdocs build (to test build)
```

### GitHub Actions (Cloud)
```
Uses: requirements.txt
Process:
  1. GitHub Actions VM starts
  2. pip install -r requirements.txt
  3. mkdocs gh-deploy
  4. Deploys to gh-pages branch
```

### Why Two Files?

- **GitHub Actions doesn't support conda/mamba**
  - It only supports pip (Python's package manager)
  - That's why we need `requirements.txt`

- **Conda/mamba is nicer for local development**
  - Better dependency resolution
  - Familiar to data scientists
  - That's why we have `environment-mkdocs.yaml`

## üí° Common Questions

### Can I delete requirements.txt?
**No!** GitHub Actions needs it to install packages in the cloud.

### Can I delete environment-mkdocs.yaml?
**Yes**, if you prefer to use pip/venv locally. But it's handy to keep.

### Can I delete the scripts/ directory?
**Yes**, unless you need to re-run the RST‚ÜíMarkdown conversion.

### Can I delete the archive/ directory?
**Yes**, once you've completed all translations. Keep for now as reference.

### Can I delete site/ directory?
**Yes**, it regenerates every build. It should be in .gitignore already.

### What about all the .md documentation files?
**Keep them!** Those are your guides - reference materials, not configuration.

## üìù Minimal Setup

If you wanted the absolute minimum files needed:

```
Required for GitHub Pages:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mkdocs.yml                   # Configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt             # For GitHub Actions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/workflows/deploy.yml # Deployment automation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                        # All your .md files
```

Everything else is documentation, helpers, or local development tools.

## üéØ Summary

| File | Purpose | Can Delete? |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `mkdocs.yml` | MkDocs config | ‚ùå No - Required |
| `requirements.txt` | GitHub Actions deps | ‚ùå No - Required |
| `environment-mkdocs.yaml` | Local conda env | ‚úÖ Yes - Optional |
| `.github/workflows/` | Auto deployment | ‚ùå No - Required |
| `docs/` | Documentation | ‚ùå No - Your content |
| `scripts/` | Conversion tools | ‚úÖ Yes - One-time use |
| `archive/` | Old translations | ‚úÖ Yes - After migration |
| `site/` | Built output | ‚úÖ Yes - Auto-regenerates |
| `*.md` (root) | Documentation | ‚úÖ Yes - But helpful |

---

**Bottom line**: Keep `requirements.txt` - GitHub Actions needs it! Everything else is optional or can be cleaned up later.
