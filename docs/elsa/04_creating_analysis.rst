Creating new ELSA analysis runs
===============================

Once an ELSA tool has been selected from the drop-down in Figure 4, users need to create and edit a new analysis run. To do this, click on the *NEW ANALYSIS RUN* button. A pop-up window will appear with the standard ELSA optimization structure with all relevant ELSA components ready for editing (see below).
