Running the optimization 
------------------------

To create an ELSA Action map showing priority areas for the implementation of policy targets for protection, restoration, management and/or urban greening actions, the optimization executed by the tool follows three hard-coded rules: 

* It should not exceed selected area-based budgets; 
* It must include selected locks or non-locks; 
* It should include the best combination of planning features based on the distribution and weighting of planning features. 

Once users have named their analysis run, set area-based budgets, lock-in functionalities and a boundary penalty factor, and edited planning feature weights, the analysis run is ready to be executed. This can be done by clicking on the blue *RUN ANALYSIS* button in the bottom-right corner of the analysis run pop-up window. Users should note that this button will only become available to click and execute once all relevant parameters have been filled in.

The analysis may take between 1 and 5 minutes to run. However, if the country is large (resulting in more planning units), there are many planning features being used, or a high boundary penalty factor is applied, it may take much longer. Users should see a progress bar documenting the status of the analysis. Once the progress bar has reached 100% and the analysis has been executed, the user can view the result of their new analysis as the most recent entry show up in the left tab under *ANALYSIS RUNS*. 


Next Steps 
----------

The following chapters detail how users can view, evaluate and analyse the results of their ELSA analysis. Should the user wish to change the parameters of their analysis and execute a new run after evaluating results, they can duplicate a previous run, edit it, and create a new version.
