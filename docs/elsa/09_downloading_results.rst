Viewing and downloading ELSA Action maps
========================================

After running an ELSA analysis, users can view the final ELSA Action map associated with that version of the analysis by toggling the analysis run in the left tab. The resulting *ELSA Action* layer which shows up on the map by default is the final action map which shows priority areas for protection, restoration, management and/or urban greening actions in the country. Similar to the heatmaps, users can zoom in to specific areas using the UNBL interface and toggle satellite imagery as well as other layers available in the workspace/UNBL public platform to evaluate final results.
