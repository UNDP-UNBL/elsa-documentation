# Viewing and downloading ELSA Action maps

After running an ELSA analysis, you can view the final action map associated with that version of the analysis by toggling the analysis run in the left tab. The resulting ‘ELSA Action’ layer that shows up on the map by default is the final action map which shows priority areas for protection, restoration, management and/or urban greening actions in your country that can best contribute to outcomes for KMGBF Targets 1-12. Similar to the heatmaps, users can zoom in to specific areas using the UNBL interface and toggle satellite imagery as well as other layers available in the workspace/UNBL public platform to evaluate the final results.
