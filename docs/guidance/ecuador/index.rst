Prioritizing Nature in Ecuador
========================================================
Section 1 describes the spatial prioritization mapping process to identify priority areas to support the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) targets in Ecuador.

Section 2 provides step-by-step instructions on how to use the webtool to re-run the spatial prioritization analysis, allowing the parameters to be adjusted according to the user's needs.

For more information on the scientific rationale behind the spatial prioritization process to identify priority areas to support the goals of the MMB in Ecuador, see Technical Report.
