2.10 Analyzing synergies and trade-offs
=========================================================
The objective of the *Prioritizing Nature* analysis is to identify synergies between actions for biodiversity, climate change and sustainable development. The analysis measures the outcome of each planning feature with a representation score to show where planning for the three themes (biodiversity, climate change and human well-being) creates trade-offs.

Where: Trade-off score = Representation in prioritization map / Maximum representation in thematic maps.

.. important::
    After running an iteration of the analysis, you can view the results and evaluate whether the parameters you selected led to an acceptable representation for each of the planning features.

Steps
1.	Go to the "Results + Download" tab, scroll down to the download section of results and model parameters (summary table), there click on "Download Summary (Excel)". This will download an Excel file with the results. 
2.	Review the results.

    - Column 1 indicates the name of the planning feature.
    - Columns 2-5 indicate the representation of the planning features in the three separate planning topic scenarios and in the combined action item scenario, for example:

      - Column 2 of combined topics, which includes all planning features;
      - Biodiversity column 3, which includes only biodiversity planning features;
      - Climate change column 4, which includes only climate change planning features;
      - Human wellbeing column 5, which includes only the human welfare planning features.

3. Column 6 shows the representation of the trade-off in percentage of the prioritization scenario (in percent) compared to the largest representation among the independent planning scenarios.

.. note::
    In the analysis of prioritizing nature, we normally use a threshold of 80% to define whether the trade-off is acceptable or not, for layers that have values lower than 80%, the user can optionally go back to the webtool and increase the weight of the corresponding planning features to low values, in order to increase their representation in the prioritization map.
