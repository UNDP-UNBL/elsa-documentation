Installing *RStudio*
====================

*R* is not a program that one simply opens and starts using, like Microsoft Word or Google Chrome. R is a computer language, much like *C++*, *Python*, or *Java Script*, etc., whereby commands (in the *R* language in our case) are passed to the operating system, which is in turn able to interpret them and provide responses (this can be as simple as adding ``2 + 2`` or as complex as making your favourite AI chat bot telling you where to eat tonight). There are various front-end coding environments (called IDEs, or Integrated Development Environments) which can be used to interact with *R*, but the most common *R* IDE is a program developped by `Posit <https://posit.co/>`_ called *RStudio* - *RStudio* will be used in all the Prioritizing Nature project training series. 

Why use an IDE like RStudio instead of the command line?
--------------------------------------------------------

-   RStudio is available for free for use with Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. 
-   Its interface, and all-in-one place design make working with *R* easier, more productive, and more organized. This is especially true for new users. 
-   *RStudio* is able to easily run `RShiny <https://shiny.posit.co/>`_ applications, of which the various ELSA tool are instances of.
-   The *R* CLI (command line interface), while fully running *R*, has very limited other features.

.. note:: 
    Even if you have *RStudio* installed, you will still need to have R installed on your computer. *RStudio* helps you use the version of R that exists on your computer, but it doesn't come with an installed version of R on its own. 

Again, you are free to use any IDE you are most composrtable using, but this workshop will using *RStudio* and troublehsooting assitance with other IDEs may not be possible. To install *RStudio*:

1.  Go to the `RStudio Desktop download website <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>`_
2.  Scroll down until you see **All Installers and Tarballs**.
3.  From the list, choose and download the corresponding version based on your computer operating system.
