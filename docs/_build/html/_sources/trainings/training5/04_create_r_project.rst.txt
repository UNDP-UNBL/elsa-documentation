Create a *Prioritizing Nature* *R* Project
==========================================

We covered the benefits of and how to create an project in R in :ref:`r_projects` of :ref:`training_3`. We are now going to create one in the repository that we just downloaded end extracted.

1) Open *Rstudio*.

2) In the upper right, click on the drop menu that shows: |proj1|

.. |proj1|  image:: images/project_create1.png

3) In the dropdown menu that opens, select: |proj2|

.. |proj2| image:: images/project_create2.png

4) In the window that opens, select *Existing Directory*:

.. image:: images/project_create3.png
    :align: center
    :width: 40%

|

5) Click on *Browse* and then navigate the location of the directory you saved the downloaded repository files:

.. image:: images/project_create4.png
    :align: center
    :width: 40%

|

6) Click *Choose* when you have entered the directory location.

7) Finally, click on the *Create Project* button.

This will create an ``.Rproj`` in the directory, and *Rstudio* will now also show that the working directory has been set to the root of the directory. You can see this shown in the console window of *Rstudio*, which should look something like the image below:

.. image:: images/project_create5.png
    :align: center
    :width: 40%

|

.. note:: 

    The name of the project defaults to the name of the folder you create it but as with many things in *R* and *Rstudio* you can change it something you find more suitable.
