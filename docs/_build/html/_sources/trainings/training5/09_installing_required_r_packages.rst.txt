Installing Required *R* Packages
================================

In :ref:`training_3` we briefly went over the basics of :ref:`installing_r_packages`. 

In this section we are going to ensure the R packages required to run the *RShiny* *Protecting Nature Webtools* are installed on your computer. You might recall that in R one can install one or more packages using the base *R* function

.. code-block:: r

    install.packages()
    install.packages(c('prioritizr', 'sf', 'terra', 'exactextractr', 'dplyr', 'ggplot2'))

or we showed how we can use other libraries such as the ``pacman`` package to install one or more functions:

.. code-block:: 

    pacman::p_load(prioritizr, sf, terra, exactextractr, dplyr, ggplot2)


In the *Protecting Nature Webtools* repository that you downloaded, this is all done within the required ``start.R`` script that is needed to run the *RShiny* application itself:

.. code-block:: r
    
    list.of.packages <- c(
        "shiny",
        "shinydashboard",
        "shinyIncubator",
        "shinymanager",
        "prioritizr",
        "here",
        "readxl",
        "writexl",
        "plyr",
        "dplyr",
        "tibble",
        "readr",
        "sf",
        "ggplot2",
        "foreign",
        "vegan",
        "terra",
        "leaflet",
        "rhandsontable",
        "googlesheets4",
        "Matrix",
        "tidyr",
        "gurobi",
        "zip",
        "DT",
        "argparser",
        "purrr",
        "devtools"
        )

    new.packages <-
    list.of.packages[!(list.of.packages %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"])]

    if (length(new.packages)) {
    install.packages(new.packages, repos = "https://cran.rstudio.com/")
    }

    if (!require(leaflet)) {
    if (!require("devtools"))
        install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("rstudio/leaflet")
    }

    if (!require(shinyIncubator)) {
    devtools::install_github("rstudio/shiny-incubator")
    }

    shiny::runApp(launch.browser = TRUE)

The ``start.R`` script will not only run and open the the app in a browser (via the function call ``shiny::runApp(launch.browser = TRUE)`` in the last line), but will also check if packages are already installed, and install them if they are not.

.. note:: 

    When we run the app (e.g., run ``start.R``) below, assuming that it correctly installs all the required *R* packages without further problems, the app will not start start and it will close with some error messages about not being able to find files. This is expected - they have not been created yet. We will address that shortly.
    

Running the App
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1) Open *RStudio* (if not already open). By default *RStudio* will open with the last opened *R Project*. If this is not the *R Project* we created perviously, click the |open_proj| button and navigate to the correct project (recently opened projects should be shown in the dropdown menu and be easy to locate).

.. |open_proj|  image:: images/project_create1.png

2) Open the ``start.R`` script by either typing ``Shift+O`` on your keyboard **OR** clicking your mouse on **File â†’ Open File...**, which will open a window showing all the files in your working directory. Select ``start.R``. You can also simply click on the **File** panel in *RStudio*, and click on the ``start.R`` file. The ``start.R`` file will open in the the editor panel.

.. image:: images/start_r1.png
    :align: center
    :width: 70%

|

3) There are two ways to run the `start.R` script:

    1) Click on the |start_r2| button on the top-right of the editor panel, or
    2) Type **Ctrl+Shift+Enter** on your keyboard.

.. |start_r2| image:: images/start_r2.png

4) Everything will have worked perfectly and all the required *R* packages will have installed without a problem. Of course.

Errors
^^^^^^

Inevitably, many of you will encounter errors while packages are being installed when `start.R` runs.

That is why we are here today in this training - to help you all troubleshoot the possible errors that you might encounter; for instance, particular *R* packages may produce errors more commonly than others (for instance, errors with ``gdal``, ``sf`` and their dependencies can be encountered occasionally on Linux systems), as are errors related to installing packages on Windows where RTools has not been installed.

We are here to help.
