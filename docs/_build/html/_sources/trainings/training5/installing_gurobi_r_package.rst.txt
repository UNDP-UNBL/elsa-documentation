Installing the Gurobi R package
===============================

To use *Gurobi's R* interface, you will need to install the *Gurobi* package in your *R* installation. The generalised *R* command for doing this is:

.. code-block:: r
    
    install.packages('<R-package-file>', repos=NULL)

The *Gurobi R* package file can be found within the directory where you installed *Gurobi* on your system (see :ref:`installing_gurobi` if you have not already successfully installed *Gurobi* on your computer). The default installation directory is:

-   For **64-bit Windows**: `C:\gurobi1201win64` , and
-   For **MacOS**: `/Library/gurobi1201/macos_universal2`,
-   For **Linux** systems: `/opt/gurobi1201/linux64`

.. note::

    Update the version number in the path if you have installed a different Gurobi version.


You will find the exact name of the file for your operating system inside the `<installdir>/R`.

-   For **64-bit Windows** this is: `gurobi_12.0-1.zip` , and
-   For **MacOS** this is: `gurobi_11.0-0_R_.tgz`,
-   For **Linux** systems this is: `gurobi_12.0-1_R_.tar.gz`

Operating specific instructions can be found below:

    For Windows users, you will also need to install the `RTools <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools44/rtools.html>`_ if you have not already done so following :ref:`additional_installations` in :ref:`training_3`.

    .. note:: 
        These compilers (Xcode, GCC, C++, Fortan, etc.) are often/typically installed on MacOS and Linux systems, so this extra installation does not apply to you if your systems runs either of these OS.

    To download RTools, click the `Rtools44 installer <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools44/files/rtools44-6459-6401.exe>`_ link, download the file, run it, and follow the installation instructions.

Depending on your local *R* environment you might need to install the R package slam. To do this, you should issue the following command in the *RStudio* console:

.. code-block:: r
    
    install.packages('slam')

.. important:: 

    You will need to be careful to make sure that the *R* binary and the *Gurobi* package you install both use the same instruction set. For example, if you are using the 64-bit version of R, youâ€™ll need to install the 64-bit version of *Gurobi*, and the 64-bit *Gurobi R* package. This is particularly important on Windows systems, where the error messages that result from instruction set mismatches can be quite cryptic.
