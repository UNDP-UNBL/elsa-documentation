*Gurobi* Cloud Access
=====================

To access our *Gurobi* Cloud Serice solvers to run the *Prioritizing Nature Webtool* and exercises in this training, you will need to:

1) Have *Gurobi* installed on your computer; **AND**

2) Have a valid license or key allowing access.

.. important:: 

    See :ref:`installing_gurobi` if *Gurobi* is not correctly installed.


When the *Gurobi* software is correctly installed  on your computer using *Gurobi* cloud service is as simple as having a ``gurobi.env`` file saved in the root directory of the location you are running the *Prioritizing Nature Webtool* from. The problems will automatically be sent to the cloud solver for computation, instead of trying to solve them lcoally (which would fail since you do not have a full gurobi license)

.. note:: 

    Unless you have an existing free Academic license setup.
