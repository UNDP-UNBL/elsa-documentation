R and RStudio - Running ELSA locally
====================================

*Software installation*

While some software tools for conservation planning (e.g. `Marxan <https://marxansolutions.org/>`_ or `Zonation <https://zonationteam.github.io/Zonation5/>`_) do not require coding skills beyond GIS skills for input data preparation, `prioritizr <https://prioritizr.net/>`_, the tool that we will be using today, is written in *R* and therefore requires a basic understanding of the *R* programming language. This allows for fast and reproducible workflows by exploiting the advantages of the programming language. It also allows pre- and post-processing of your data, all in *R*.

Therefore, we need to install *R*, RStudio, and some other requirements for using `prioritizr`.

.. important:: 

   Even if you already have `R`, RStudio, and some of the required packages installed, we recommend making sure that all of these are updated regularly and on the latest version. Some of the material provided here might throw errors if old software versions are used.
