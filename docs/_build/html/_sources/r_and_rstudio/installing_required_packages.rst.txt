Install and use R packages for the Prioritizing Nature project 

You must first install the R packages on your computer and then load it in your current R session. The easiest way to install an R package is with the install.packages R function. To do this, open your RStudio and type the following into the command line: 

install.packages("<package name>") 

 

You can also install multiple packages at once by linking their names with R’s concatenate function, c. For the training sessions, we recommend you use this funtion to install all the various R packages we are going to use. Copy and paste the following code into your Rstudio and then click on run: 

install.packages(c("prioritizr", "terra", "sf","raster"," exactextractr ", "dplyr","ggplot2","Scott to populate as needed from here")) 

 

Installing a package doesn’t immediately place its functions at your fingertips. It just places them on your computer. To use an R package, you next have to load it in your R session with the command: 

library(<package name>) 

 

For the training sessions, we recommend you use this funtion to load all the R packages we are going to use. Copy and paste the following code into your Rstudio and then click on run: 

.. code-block:: r
    
    library(prioritizr) 
    library(raster) 
    library(sf) 
    library(dplyr) 
    library(exactextractr) 
    library(terra) 
    library(here)
