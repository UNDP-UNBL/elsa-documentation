Understanding Heatmaps
----------------------

**Start with heatmaps** - it's recommended to view heatmap layers before examining final action maps.

What Are Heatmaps?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Heatmaps identify important locations for achieving KMGBF targets by showing the normalized sum of planning features' values in each planning unit, accounting for user-assigned weights.

**Heatmap Interpretation:**

* **Color coding**: Green to yellow gradient indicates importance levels
* **Bright yellow**: Most important areas (highest planning feature concentration)
* **Green**: Moderately important areas  
* **Grey/No color**: Lower importance areas

**Using Heatmaps:**

* Identify areas with greatest overall contribution to KMGBF targets
* Validate patterns against local knowledge and expectations
* Understand spatial distribution of priority features
* Guide interpretation of final action maps

Analyzing Heatmap Patterns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Validation Approach:**

1. **Compare with expectations**: Do patterns match your understanding of the region?
2. **Overlay satellite imagery**: Toggle base maps to understand landscape context
3. **Examine individual features**: View specific planning layers that contribute to high-value areas
4. **Cross-reference local knowledge**: Validate patterns with ground-truth information

**Map Controls:**

* **Toggle satellite imagery**: Click 'MAP CONTROLS' → eye icon to show/hide satellite base
* **Adjust opacity**: Use opacity slider to blend heatmap with satellite imagery
* **Switch base maps**: Choose between satellite, roads, or terrain views

Viewing ELSA Action Maps
------------------------

The ELSA Action map shows the final priority areas for different nature-based actions based on your optimization parameters.

**Action Map Components:**

* **Protection zones** (typically green): Areas prioritized for biodiversity conservation
* **Restoration zones** (typically yellow): Areas identified for ecological restoration
* **Management zones**: Areas for sustainable use and management
* **Urban greening**: Urban areas for nature-based solutions

**Interpreting Action Maps:**

* **Spatial distribution**: How are different actions distributed across your landscape?
* **Connectivity**: Are priority areas well-connected or fragmented?  
* **Accessibility**: Are priority areas accessible for implementation?
* **Land use compatibility**: Do suggestions align with current land use patterns?

Analyzing Feature Representations
---------------------------------

Understanding how well each planning feature is represented in your final solution is crucial for evaluating trade-offs and synergies.

Accessing Representation Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Method 1: Information Box**

1. **Click the 'i' icon** in the layer legend of your toggled analysis run
2. **View summary table** showing representation scores for each feature
3. **Examine area allocations** for each action type

.. figure:: images/feature-representations.png

**Information Displayed:**

* **Action Area Allocation**: Total area allocated to each action type
* **Feature Representations Table**: 
  * **Weight**: User-assigned importance weight
  * **Overall**: Overall representation score across all actions
  * **Protect/Restore**: Action-specific representation scores

Understanding Representation Scores
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Representation Score Calculation:**
``Representation Score = Representation in prioritization map / Maximum representation in thematic maps``

**Score Interpretation:**

* **0-30%**: Low representation - feature may be under-represented
* **30-70%**: Moderate representation - balanced inclusion
* **70-100%**: High representation - feature is well-captured

**Trade-off Analysis:**

* **High representation** in one theme may mean **lower representation** in others
* **Balanced scores** across themes indicate good synergies
* **Highlighted cells** indicate actions that each feature layer will impact

Evaluating Analysis Quality
---------------------------

Use these criteria to assess whether your analysis meets your objectives:

**Spatial Coherence:**
* Are priority areas spatially clustered and connected?
* Do results align with known biodiversity/climate patterns?
* Are there logical connections between protection and restoration areas?

**Feature Balance:**
* Are all important features adequately represented?
* Do any critical features have unexpectedly low representation?
* Are there acceptable trade-offs between different themes?

**Implementation Feasibility:**
* Are priority areas accessible and manageable?
* Do results align with existing conservation initiatives?
* Are there potential conflicts with current land use?

**Target Achievement:**
* Does the analysis meet your area-based budget targets?
* Are KMGBF target contributions balanced appropriately?
* Do results support your national conservation priorities?

Iterative Improvement Process
----------------------------

Based on your results evaluation, you may want to adjust parameters and rerun analyses:

**Common Adjustments:**

**If feature representation is too low:**
* Increase weights for under-represented features
* Adjust area budgets to allow more inclusion
* Consider relaxing spatial constraints

**If spatial clustering is insufficient:**
* Increase boundary penalty factor
* Review lock-in settings
* Adjust action zone budgets

**If results don't match expectations:**
* Review and adjust feature weights
* Examine individual input layers for data quality
* Consult with local experts on parameter settings

**Creating New Scenarios:**

1. **Duplicate existing analysis**: Use the 'Duplicate' option from the three-dot menu
2. **Modify specific parameters**: Make targeted adjustments based on evaluation
3. **Use descriptive naming**: Clearly indicate what changes were made
4. **Compare results**: Evaluate multiple scenarios side-by-side

Analyzing Synergies and Trade-offs
---------------------------------

One key outcome of ELSA analysis is identifying synergies between actions for biodiversity, climate change, and sustainable development.

**Trade-off Score Calculation:**
``Trade-off Score = Representation in prioritization map / Maximum representation in thematic maps``

**Interpreting Synergies:**
* **High representation across multiple themes**: Indicates strong synergies
* **Concentrated representation in one theme**: May indicate trade-offs
* **Balanced moderate representation**: Suggests good compromise solutions

**Using Trade-off Analysis:**
* Identify win-win areas for multiple objectives
* Understand where compromises are necessary
* Inform stakeholder discussions about priority setting
* Guide adaptive management strategies

Advanced Visualization Techniques
---------------------------------

**Combining Multiple Layers:**
* Toggle between heatmaps and action maps
* Overlay input layers to understand driver patterns
* Use satellite imagery for landscape context
* Compare different analysis scenarios

**Zooming and Navigation:**
* Use UNBL zoom controls for detailed examination
* Focus on specific regions of interest
* Examine boundary transitions between action zones
* Identify connectivity corridors

**Export for External Analysis:**
* Screenshot high-resolution images for presentations
* Note specific coordinates for field verification
* Document interesting patterns for further investigation
