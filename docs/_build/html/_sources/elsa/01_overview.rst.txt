Overview of the ELSA Integrated Spatial Planning Tool
=====================================================

The ELSA tool is a customized application of the `Essential Life Support Area (ELSA) <https://www.undp.org/publications/integrated-spatial-planning-workbook>`_ framework, a participatory approach to integrated spatial planning that empowers nations to meet their biodiversity, climate, and sustainable development commitments. The ELSA tool is designed specifically to support national action around the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) targets and indicators. The ELSA tool does not require any coding or modelling skills and is easy to use for people who are not spatial data experts. 

This free, open-source, cloud-hosted tool provides stakeholders in all countries with a science-based methodology to identify national priority areas where protection, restoration, management, and urban greening can lead to the best outcomes across the GBF targets and indicators. By leveraging global datasets and advanced scenario modeling, the ELSA tool allows users to adjust priorities, set constraints, and revisit their plans to ensure critical areas are adequately protected or restored while addressing economic and societal needs. The resulting spatial prioritization map can directly support the implementation of GBF Targets 1, 2, and 3, with co-benefits for Targets 4-12. This interactive and flexible process ensures that decision-making is both evidence-based and adaptable, supporting better outcomes for people and the planet.
