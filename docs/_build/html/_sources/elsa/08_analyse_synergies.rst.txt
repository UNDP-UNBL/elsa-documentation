Analysing synergies and trade-offs
==================================

One outcome of the ELSA analysis is to identify synergies between actions for biodiversity, climate change and sustainable development. The analysis measures the outcome of each planning feature with a representation score to show where planning for the three themes (biodiversity, climate change and human well-being) creates trade-offs. Where: 

.. math::

   \text{Trade-off score} = \frac{\text{Representation in prioritization map}}{\text{Maximum representation}}
   

in the thematic maps. 

After running an analysis, users can view the results and evaluate whether the parameters selected led to an acceptable representation for each of the planning features. 

Users can review feature representations by clicking the ‘i’ icon in the layer legend of the toggled analysis run. This will display a test information window with the total land area allocated to each nature-based action in the analysis, as well as a table showing the weight, overall representation and individual representation for each nature-based action for each planning feature.

Users can alternatively save this same information to their local computers by clicking on the three vertical dots button next to the entry of their analysis run and then clicking on *Download CSV* or *Download JSON*, depending on the format they desire. Users can additionally click on *Download Excel summary* to download a more comprehensive test information sheet which shows data descriptions and metadata for each planning feature, descriptions of policy targets used for the analysis and ELSA analysis resources alongside the representation scores.

Users can evaluate representation scores for planning features of their choice and iteratively duplicate and run additional analysis runs with increased/decreased weights for planning features depending on whether they want to increase/decrease their representation in the final ELSA map.
