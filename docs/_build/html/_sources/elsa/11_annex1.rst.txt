Annex 1: Key terms used in the process of mapping priority areas for the implementation of the KMGBF. 
=====================================================================================================

.. glossary::

   Area-based Budget
      The maximum area (expressed as a percentage of the total area of the country) that can be assigned to a specific action zone (protection, restoration, management, or urban greening).

   Boundary Penalty Factor (BPF)
      A parameter that penalizes solutions based on the total outer boundary or edge of the zones. By penalizing solutions with large edge length, this BPF promotes spatial cohesion or clustering in the spatial prioritization zones of priority areas for GBF implementation.

   Decision support software
      A computer application that uses information about possible actions and the limitations of those actions to assist the decision-making process in achieving a stated objective.

   Geographic Information System (GIS)
      Computer system consisting of hardware and software necessary for the capture, storage, management, analysis and presentation of geographic (spatial) data.

   Planning Features
      An element of biodiversity, climate change adaptation and/or mitigation and human ecosystem service for human well-being selected as a focus for conservation planning or action. It may include ecological classifications, habitat types, species, physical objects, processes, or any element that can be measured in a planning unit. In the process of spatial prioritization of priority areas for GBF implementation, each priority commitment for a country may correspond to one or more planning features depending on its complexity.

   Planning Units
      Planning units are the basic elements of a reserve system. A study area is divided into planning units that are smaller geographic parcels of regular or irregular shapes. Examples are squares, hexagons, cadastral parcels and hydrological units.

   Representation
      In Systematic Conservation Planning, a representative system captures the full range of planning features (species, ecosystems, and ecosystem services) occurring in the planning region, not just iconic species.

   Restrictions
      A constraint that must be met during optimization, as it creates a network of areas. The main constraints are that the budget (land area devoted to each spatial prioritization action) is not exceeded and that each zone can only occur within specified planning units (e.g. the protection zone can only be possible in planning units that are not agricultural or urban coverage).

   Systematic Conservation Planning (SCP)
      A formal method for identifying potential areas for conservation management that will most efficiently achieve a specific set of objectives, commonly some minimum representation of biodiversity. The process involves a clear and structured approach to priority setting, and is now the norm for both terrestrial and marine conservation. The effectiveness of systematic conservation planning lies in its ability to make the best use of limited fiscal resources to achieve conservation objectives and to do so in a way that is defensible, accountable, and transparently recognizes the needs of different resource users.

   User interface
      The means by which people interact with a given computer application. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) presents information in a simple way using graphics, menus and icons.

   Weights
      The weights allow users to set relative priorities within their priority policy outcomes. Values typically range from "0" (no importance) to "10" (extremely high importance).

   Action Zones 
      A land use zone, equivalent to a nature-based action, which serves to enhance specific planning objects. Zones are determined by restrictions that define where an action may or may not absolutely occur. For example, these hard constraints limit protection to intact areas (e.g., low human footprint values) and protection/restoration to areas that are moderately impacted by human activity, but not totally dominated by humans (e.g., low and medium human footprint values).

   Lock-in Features
      Specific features or areas that are locked-in to a solution. Typically, this would refer to existing protected areas, that are by default locked into an SCP problem creation.
