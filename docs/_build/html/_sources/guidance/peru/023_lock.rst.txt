2.3 Lock-in functions
=====================

Lock-in functionalities are applied to potential OECMs and degraded areas within Protected Areas for restoration.  Lock-in these areas ensures their inclusion in the ELSA areas to identify priority areas to support the implementation of the ENDB during optimization.

Lock-in of OECM potentials:

- Select "Potential OECM lock-in" if you want to force the analysis to include potential OECM areas within the "protection" action. In addition to showing the areas of potential OECMs, the resulting map will also show where new OECMs should be placed.
- Select "Nothing is locked" if you wish to independently assess the optimal location of OECMs in your country based on the ELSA analysis to identify priority areas to support the implementation of the ENDB .

    **Currently for Peru, potential OECMs cover 17.37% of the country.**
    
    Therefore, the selection of "Potential OECM Lock-in" requires that at least 17.37% of the national territory be assigned under the "Protection Objective".
