1.	Introduction to the Prioritizing Nature in Peru
=======================================================

Background
----------

Humanity depends on nature in fundamental ways: for its livelihoods, economies, well-being and ability to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Placing nature at the center of all activities is therefore essential to ensure sustainable societies. The importance of nature has been recognized by the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) with the adoption, in December 2022, of the `Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework <https://www.cbd.int/gbf>`_.

Spatial data are essential for the implementation of several GBF targets, they will also be essential for countries to monitor and report on progress towards these targets, where `41% of the headline indicators and 34% of the component indicators have a methodology that encourages the use of spatial data <https://unbiodiversitylab.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SP_Guidance-Using-Spatial-Data-to-Support-GBF.pdf>`_. In this regard, `GBF Target 3 <https://www.cbd.int/gbf/targets/3>`_, also known as the 30x30 Target aims to conserve 30% of terrestrial areas, inland waters and seas by 2030. In addition to this high-level quantitative goal, the target includes qualitative elements, such as "ecologically representative, well-connected and equitably governed" systems. The target also mentions various conservation approaches, including protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures (OECM), as well as recognition and respect for the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities. For this target, the use of geospatial data is extremely relevant for identifying conservation areas, as well as for monitoring and reporting on the impacts of various types of conservation schemes.

ELSA mapping in support of the GBF and ENDB targets
---------------------------------------------------

UNDP, through a partnership with Peru and the United Nations Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC), implemented the Prioritizing Nature project to support the national use of spatial data to achieve GBF Target 3 and the equivalent target at the national level. The project built on previous collaborations using innovative tools such as the `UN Biodiversity Lab <https://unbiodiversitylab.org/>`_ (UNBL) and effective methodologies such as the `Maps of Hope <http://www.mapsofhope.org/>`_ in which countries identify ELSAs where nature protection, management and restoration measures can best contribute to the achievement of various national priority policy objectives in biodiversity, climate and sustainable development. 

The project mobilized key national stakeholders and experts to carry out a series of scientific activities to develop an ELSA map that supports the goals of the GBF and the ENDB. In Peru, work was carried out with national partners, in particular the Ministry of Environment (MINAM), to support the country to identify and assess potential conservation areas based on existing land governance and management, improve network connectivity and support the achievement of national environmental and socioeconomic priorities; this led to supporting the government to propose forms of protection to meet the 30x30 Target in Peru.

To develop the ELSA map, Systematic Conservation Planning (SCP) was used to analyze land use zones and outcomes. SCP is used to optimize spatially explicit conservation actions to promote the persistence of biodiversity and other natural features in situ. SCP involves a transparent and objective process of setting clear goals and objectives, and then planning conservation actions that meet them. The  ELSA mapping process was developed to directly support the spatial elements of the GBF and the ENDB targets. This includes Goals 1-3, which set goals around spatial planning, sustainable management, ecosystem restoration, and protection through protected areas and OECMs. Other spatial elements were also drawn from GBF Targets 4-12, which cover threatened species, climate change and a range of ecosystem services.

The project has helped Peru to:

- Jointly develop an ELSA action map that demonstrates a pathway to achieve GBF Target 3, while supporting the other targets of the GBF and Peru's NBSAP;
- Assess potential OECMs to support the government in identifying priority areas for site-level assessments; and
- Assess the condition within existing protected areas and OECMs.

.. Important::
    - For more details on the methodology and science applied in the ELSA process in Peru to identify priority areas to support the implementation of the GBF, please refer to the Technical Report.
    - Project results are also available on the Peru secure workspace at the `UN Biodiversity Lab <https://unbiodiversitylab.org/>`_ a UN-supported platform that provides countries with access to the best global and national spatial data on biodiversity, ecosystem services and sustainable development.

The Association
---------------

Working with Peru this project brings together a powerful coalition of governments, NGOs, research institutes and intergovernmental organizations.
UNDP through a partnership with Peru and the United Nations Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Center (UNEP-WCMC), with funding from the Bezos Earth Fund, implemented the Prioritizing Nature project to support the national use of spatial data to achieve GBF Target 3 and the equivalent target at the national level.

Participating institutions include: Ministry of Environment (MINAM), National Forestry and Wildlife Service (SERFOR), Supervisory Body of Forestry and Wildlife Resources (OSINFOR), National Service of Natural Protected Areas (SERNANP), National Institute for the Protection of the Environment (INAFOR), National Institute of
Agricultural Research (INIA), TNC, WCS, Jica, among others.
