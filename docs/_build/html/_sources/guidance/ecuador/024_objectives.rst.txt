2.4 Objectives
==============

This part of the spatial prioritization webtool to identify priority areas to support the implementation of the GBF allows you to set area-based targets for protection, restoration, and management. Targets can also be understood as the percentage of land area that can be allocated to each action within the country. The default values in the Prioritizing Nature webtool are derived from the targets in the GBF in Ecuador (see Table 1).

**Steps**

1.	Set any value greater than or equal to 0.001 for protection, restoration and management objectives. The sum of the value for all objectives may be less than or equal to 100%, but should not exceed 100%.

.. important:: 
    Currently, about 63.07% of Ecuador has potential OECM coverage. Therefore, if you select "block-in potential OECM", the protection target here should be at least 63.07%.

The lock-in restrictions used in Ecuador to spatially define where each of these actions can occur are summarized in the below table.
