Using *RStudio*: A (very) brief guide!
======================================

Now that you have both *R* and *RStudio* installed on your computer, you can begin using *R* by opening the *RStudio* program. Open *RStudio* just as you would any program, by clicking on its icon or by typing “RStudio” at the Windows Run prompt. 

Layout
^^^^^^

*RStudio* has four main panes each in a quadrant of your screen. You can set what appears in each (through Tools/Options menu in Windows or *RStudio*/Preference on a Mac), but the default shows:

-   Console (bottom left)
-   Source editor (top left)
-   Environment and History (top right), and
-   Plots, Files, Packages, Help, Viewer (bottom right).

Each pane can be minimized or maximized within the column by clicking the minimize/maximize buttons - these also show which shows a collapsed or expanded Window.. 

Customising the Layout
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can change the layout of the panes, and their arrangement, to something you prefer by modying these setting within ``Tools > Global Options > Pane Layout``.
