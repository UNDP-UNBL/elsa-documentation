msgid "The objective of the *Prioritizing Nature* analysis is to identify synergies between actions for biodiversity, climate change and sustainable development. The analysis measures the outcome of each planning feature with a representation score to show where planning for the three themes (biodiversity, climate change and human well-being) creates trade-offs."

msgid "In the analysis of prioritizing nature, we normally use a threshold of 80% to define whether the trade-off is acceptable or not, for layers that have values lower than 80%, the user can optionally go back to the webtool and increase the weight of the corresponding planning features to low values, in order to increase their representation in the prioritization map."
