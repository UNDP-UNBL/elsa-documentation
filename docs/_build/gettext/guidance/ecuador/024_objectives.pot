msgid "This part of the spatial prioritization webtool to identify priority areas to support the implementation of the GBF allows you to set area-based targets for protection, restoration, and management. Targets can also be understood as the percentage of land area that can be allocated to each action within the country. The default values in the Prioritizing Nature webtool are derived from the targets in the GBF in Ecuador (see Table 1)."
