msgid "*R* is not a program that one simply opens and starts using, like Microsoft Word or Google Chrome. R is a computer language, much like *C++*, *Python*, or *Java Script*, etc., whereby commands (in the *R* language in our case) are passed to the operating system, which is in turn able to interpret them and provide responses (this can be as simple as adding ``2 + 2`` or as complex as making your favourite AI chat bot telling you where to eat tonight). There are various front-end coding environments (called IDEs, or Integrated Development Environments) which can be used to interact with *R*, but the most common *R* IDE is a program developped by `Posit <https://posit.co/>`_ called *RStudio* - *RStudio* will be used in all the Prioritizing Nature project training series."
