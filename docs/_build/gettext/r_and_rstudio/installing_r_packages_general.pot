msgid "One of the most useful things about the *R* language is the very large number of software libraries that *R* users have created for often very specific use cases. Indeed, many of *R*'s most useful functions are found in these packages. An *R* package bundles together useful functions, help files, and data sets, and they can be used within your own *R* scripts once you have installed and then loaded the library in your *R* session."
