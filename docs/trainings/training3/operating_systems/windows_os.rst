Additional installations
------------------------

For Windows users we also recommend installing the `RTools <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools44/rtools.html>`_  package. *RTools* is toolchain bundle used for building *R* packages from source, which may require a software compiler that may not be available on most Windows systems.

.. note:: 
    These compilers (Xcode, GCC, C++, Fortan, etc.) are often/typically installed on MacOS and Linux systems, so this extra installation does not apply to you if your systems runs either of these OS.

To download RTools, click the `Rtools44 installer <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools44/files/rtools44-6414-6401.exe>`_ link, download the file, run it, and follow the installation instructions.
