# Create a *Prioritizing Nature* *R* Project

We covered the benefits of and how to create an project in R in :ref:`r_projects` of :ref:`training_3`. We are now going to create one in the repository that we just downloaded end extracted.

1) Open *RStudio*.

2) In the upper right, click on the drop menu that shows: |proj1|

.. |proj1|  image:: images/project_create1.png

3) In the dropdown menu that opens, select: |proj2|

.. |proj2| image:: images/project_create2.png

4) In the window that opens, select *Existing Directory*:

![project_create3.png](images/project_create3.png)

5) Click on *Browse* and then navigate the location of the directory you saved the downloaded repository files:

![project_create4.png](images/project_create4.png)

6) Click *Choose* when you have entered the directory location.

7) Finally, click on the *Create Project* button.

This will create an `.Rproj` in the directory, and *RStudio* will now also show that the working directory has been set to the root of the directory. You can see this shown in the console window of *RStudio*, which should look something like the image below:

![project_create5.png](images/project_create5.png)

!!! note
    The name of the project defaults to the name of the folder you create it but as with many things in *R* and *RStudio* you can change it something you find more suitable.
