# Training 5: Running Spatial Prioritisations

This training module is going cover two main components:

1) We will pick back up again from :ref:`training_3` and further set up your computers to run the *Prioritizing Nature Webtools* on your own computers, using the *Gurobi* solver; and
2) We will go through setting analyses on the working *Prioritizing Nature Webtools* - you will then be able to run some analyses on your computer.

This is an online workshop (followed by interactive exercises) that will provide training on how to:

-   Connect to and access the software's online repository (on *Github* - no registration needed)
-   Correctly install required *R* packages needed for the tool to run;
-   Correctly install the *Gurobi* solver software;
-   Set up usage of our paid *Gurobi* Cloud services for use during the workshop; and
-   Correctly run the *Prioritizing Nature Webtools* tool locally from within *Rstudio* to generate the spatial prioritization map. 

At the end the training you should have a better understanding of the webtools, the software that they use, and greater clarity on how various changes to the tool's parameters can greatly change the outputs and identified priority areas.

!!! important
    Participants are expected to have basic knowledge of GIS, *R* software and language, such as running scripts in *R*. The latter of these topics were covered in :ref:`training_3`.
