"The ELSA Tool enables diverse stakeholders to collaboratively assess "
"national priorities for the KMGBF, explore trade-offs and synergies, and "
"develop spatial plans to support national implementation of Targets 1, 2,"
" and 3. The ELSA Tool produces spatial prioritization maps that identify "
"areas for protection, restoration, management, and urban greening that "
"will have the highest impact towards achieving KMGBF Targets 1-12.  Users"
" with a `UNBL workspace <https://unbiodiversitylab.org/en/unbl-"
"workspaces/>`_ can use the ELSA Tool to execute a customized national "
"spatial prioritization as part of a participatory spatial planning "
"process. They can:"

"The ELSA Tool uses the *prioritizr* package in the back end as a spatial "
"optimization tool to run an ELSA analysis. *prioritizr* supports a broad "
"range of objectives, constraints and penalties to create a tailored "
"analysis. Optimizations can be executed quickly on UNBL (often within 3-5"
" minutes). It can therefore be used to generate and refine conservation "
"plans in real-time during stakeholder meetings, and contribute to a more "
"transparent, inclusive, and participatory decision-making process to "
"identify priority areas to support the implementation of KMGBF Targets 1,"
" 2 and 3, with powerful co-benefits for Targets 4-12."
