"After running an ELSA analysis, you can view the final action map "
"associated with that version of the analysis by toggling the analysis run"
" in the left tab. The resulting ‘ELSA Action’ layer that shows up on the "
"map by default is the final action map which shows priority areas for "
"protection, restoration, management and/or urban greening actions in your"
" country that can best contribute to outcomes for KMGBF Targets 1-12. "
"Similar to the heatmaps, users can zoom in to specific areas using the "
"UNBL interface and toggle satellite imagery as well as other layers "
"available in the workspace/UNBL public platform to evaluate the final "
"results."
