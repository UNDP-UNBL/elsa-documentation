"Once you have named your analysis run, set area-based constraints, lock-"

"feature weights, the analysis run is ready to be executed. This can be "
"done by clicking on the blue ‘RUN ANALYSIS’ button in the bottom-right "
"corner of the analysis run pop-up window. Note that this button will only"
" become available to click and execute once all relevant parameters have "
"been filled in."

"The analysis may take between one and five minutes to run. However, if "
"the country is large, there are many planning features being used, or a "
"high boundary penalty factor is applied, it may take much longer. You "
"will see a progress bar documenting the status of the analysis. We advise"
" against running a second ELSA analysis while before the first analysis "
"has completed. Once the progress bar has reached 100% and the analysis "
"has been executed, you can view the result of your analysis as the most "
"recent entry in the left tab under ‘ANALYSIS RUNS’."
