"The exact methods for installing the *Gurobi* solver depends on the "

"Broadly speaking, on Windows systems, you need only double-click on the "
"*Gurobi* installer, follow the prompts, and the installer will "
"automatically handle everything for you (using default settings). On "
"Linux and MacOS systems, you will need to manually extract the downloaded"
" file’s contents to a folder, move the extracted contents to a suitable "
"location (typically ``/opt/gurobi``), and update your system’s variables "
"so that it knows where to find *Gurobi* (i.e., the PATH variable). See OS"
" specific instructions below for more details."
