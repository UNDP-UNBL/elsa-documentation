"*R* is not a program like Microsoft Word or Google Chrome that a user "
"simply opens and starts doing some work with. Rather, *R* is a computer "
"language, much like *C++*, *Python*, or *Java Script*, etc., whereby "
"commands (in the *R* language in our case) are passed to the operating "
"system, which in turn is able to interpret them (using an interpreter) "
"and provide responses (this can be as simple as adding ``2 + 2`` or as "
"complex as sending queries to your favourite AI chat bot asking where the"
" nearest phá»Ÿ restaurant is to eat at tonight). There are various front-"
"end coding environments (called IDEs, or Integrated Development "
"Environments) which can be used to interact with *R*, but the most common"
" *R* IDE is a program developed by `Posit <https://posit.co/>`_ called "
"*RStudio* - *RStudio* will be used in all the Prioritizing Nature project"
" training series."

"Even if you have *RStudio* installed, you will still need to have R "
