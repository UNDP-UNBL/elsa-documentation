"Most software tools for conservation planning (e.g. `Marxan "
"<https://marxansolutions.org/>`_ or `Zonation "
"<https://zonationteam.github.io/Zonation5/>`_) do not require any "
"specific coding skills, and only require basic GIS capabilities to "
"correctly extract and prepare input data. However, `prioritizr "
"<https://prioritizr.net/>`_, the tool that runs behind the scenes in ELSA"
" (that we will be using today) is written in *R* and having a basic "
"understanding of the *R* programming language will help with both small-"
"scale troubleshooting and provide a better understanding of the inner "
"workings of the ELSA tools. On top of that, understanding how *R* (or any"
" computer language you work with) operates allows for creating fast and "
"reproducible workflows by exploiting the advantages of the programming "
"language. It also allows for pre- and post-processing of your data, all "
"in *R*."

"The first step to all this (of course) is to install *R*. We will also "
"install several other useful and required software programs (or "
"libraries), such as *RStudio*, that either are requirements for using "
"*prioritizr* or will simply make our lives a little bit easier."

"Even if you already have *R*, *RStudio*, and some of the required "
"packages installed, we recommend making sure that all of these are "
"updated regularly and on the latest version. Some of the material "
"provided here might throw errors if old software versions are used."
