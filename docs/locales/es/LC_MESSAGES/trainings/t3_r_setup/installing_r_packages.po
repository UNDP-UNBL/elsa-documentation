"One of the most useful things about the *R* language is the very large "
"number of software libraries that *R* users have created for often very "
"specific use cases. Indeed, many of *R*'s most useful functions are found"
" in these packages. An *R* package bundles together useful functions, "
"help files, and data sets, and they can be used within your own *R* "
"scripts once you have installed and then loaded the library in your *R* "
"session."
