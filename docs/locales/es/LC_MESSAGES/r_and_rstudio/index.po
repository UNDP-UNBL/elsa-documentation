"While some software tools for conservation planning (e.g. `Marxan "
"<https://marxansolutions.org/>`_ or `Zonation "
"<https://zonationteam.github.io/Zonation5/>`_) do not require coding "
"skills beyond GIS skills for input data preparation, `prioritizr "
"<https://prioritizr.net/>`_, the tool that we will be using today, is "
"written in *R* and therefore requires a basic understanding of the *R* "
"programming language. This allows for fast and reproducible workflows by "
"exploiting the advantages of the programming language. It also allows "
"pre- and post-processing of your data, all in *R*."

"Even if you already have `R`, RStudio, and some of the required packages "
"installed, we recommend making sure that all of these are updated "
"regularly and on the latest version. Some of the material provided here "
"might throw errors if old software versions are used."
