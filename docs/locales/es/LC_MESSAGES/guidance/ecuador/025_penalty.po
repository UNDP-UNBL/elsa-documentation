"The boundary penalty factor is used to promote spatial cohesion when "
"prioritizing land use zones. The boundary penalty can be 0 or higher. The"
" higher the value, the more connected and contiguous the prioritization "
"action zones will be on the map, making it more enforceable. This "
"adjustment is based on the idea that, for real-world planning, a more "
"connected zone is usually easier to manage and execute actions."

"Increase the number iteratively, i.e., rerun the optimization repeatedly,"
" by an order of magnitude (e.g., 0.00001 -> 0.0001 -> 0.001), reducing "
"the rate of increase as you approach solutions that lead to your desired "
"level of clustering. Each time you change the penalty, you will have to "
"rerun the optimization until you arrive at a map that is sufficiently "
"contiguous to meet your needs."
