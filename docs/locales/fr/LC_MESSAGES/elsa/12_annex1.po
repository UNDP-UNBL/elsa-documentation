msgid ""
"A land use zone, equivalent to a nature-based action, which serves to "
"enhance specific planning objects. Zones are determined by restrictions that "
"define where an action may or may not absolutely occur. For example, these "
"hard restrictions limit protection to intact areas (e.g., low human "
"footprint values) and protection/restoration to areas that are moderately "
"impacted by human activity, but not totally dominated by humans (e.g., low "
"and medium human footprint values)."

"A spatial dataset used to map spatial elements of KMGBF Targets 1-12. Each "

"A formal method for identifying potential areas for conservation management "

"some minimum representation of biodiversity. The process involves a clear "
"and structured approach to priority setting, and is now the norm for both "
"terrestrial and marine conservation. The effectiveness of systematic "
