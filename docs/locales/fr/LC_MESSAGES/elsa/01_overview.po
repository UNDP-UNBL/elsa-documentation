"The ELSA tool is a customized application of the `Essential Life Support "
"Area (ELSA) <https://www.undp.org/publications/integrated-spatial-planning-"
"workbook>`_ framework, a participatory approach to integrated spatial "
"planning that empowers nations to meet their biodiversity, climate, and "
"sustainable development commitments. The ELSA Tool is designed specifically "
"to support national action around the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity "
"Framework (KMGBF) targets and indicators. The ELSA Tool does not require any "
"coding or modelling skills and is easy to use for people who are not spatial "
"data experts."

"This free, open-source, cloud-hosted tool provides stakeholders in all "
"countries with a science-based methodology to identify national priority "
"areas where protection, restoration, management, and urban greening can lead "
"to the best outcomes across the KMGBF targets and indicators. By leveraging "
"global datasets and advanced scenario modeling, the ELSA Tool allows users "
"to adjust priorities, set constraints, and revisit their plans to ensure "
"critical areas are adequately protected or restored while addressing "
"economic and societal needs. The resulting spatial prioritization map can "
"directly support the implementation of KMGBF Targets 1, 2, and 3, with co-"
"benefits for Targets 4-12. This interactive and flexible process ensures "
"that decision-making is both evidence-based and adaptable, supporting better "
"outcomes for people and the planet."
