"The *Prioritizing Nature Webtool* you have running locally on your computer "
"is the same application that you can access running online for either "
"`Ecuador <https://elsa.unbiodiversitylab.org/Bezos_ECU/>`_ or `Peru <https://"
"elsa.unbiodiversitylab.org/Bezos_PER/>`_. You may be familiar with the "
"tool's layout from previous trainings, meetings and workshops, but below we "
"provide an overview of the layout of webtool running on front of you."
