"This part of the ELSA webtool to identify priority areas to support the "
"implementation of the ENDB allows you to set area-based targets for "
"protection, restoration, and management. Targets can also be understood as "
"the percentage of land area that can be allocated to each action within the "
"country. The default values in the Prioritizing Nature webtool are derived "
"from the targets in the ENDB in Peru (see Table 1)."
