"Upon executing an ELSA analysis, you will be able to view results by "
"clicking on the vertical three dots next to the analysis entry in the "
"left tab and clicking on the ‘View’ button. In the drop-down menu of the "
"legend that appears on the map, you can choose between viewing the final "
"action map or heatmap layers. We suggest that you view the heatmaps "
"first."

"Heatmaps identify important locations for achieving KMGBF Targets 1-12, "
"or other policy targets specified by your country. They are the "
"normalised sum of planning features’ values in each planning unit, "
"accounting for the user weights given to each planning feature. Important"
" areas (where more planning features occur, adjusted for weighting) are "
"shown in a range of colours from green to yellow, with those in bright "
"yellow being the most important. Heatmaps can be used to identify areas "
"where the overall contribution of planning features to KMGBF Targets 1-12"
" is greatest."

"By evaluating heatmaps, data experts can view the aggregated user-"
"weighted planning feature data to determine if the patterns match their "
"expectations and personal knowledge of the region. To assist in this "
"process, users can toggle between the heatmaps and underlying satellite "
"imagery/road maps/planning feature maps, which helps orient the heatmaps "
"on the landscape and identify which planning features are specifically "
"contributing to areas of high importance for the KMGBF targets."

"To toggle satellite imagery and roads, users should click on the ‘MAP "
"CONTROLS’ button on the bottom-right of the UNBL data app. Users can then"
" click on the eye icon in the legend box to hide the heatmap and view "
"satellite imagery, or the opacity button to the left of the eye icon to "
"reduce the opacity of the heatmap and see underlying satellite imagery "
"and the heatmap at the same time."
