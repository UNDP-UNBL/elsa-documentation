"Before running the optimization, clicking on the \"Results Map\" in the "
"right panel will create four heat map (HM) layers. The heat maps identify "
"important locations for the nine biodiversity targets of the GBF for "
"Ecuador . They are the result of the intersection of the planning features "
"and their respective weightings. The higher the value in a range from zero "
"to one, the more elements with high weights overlap. Thus, they can be "
"identified as hotspots for biodiversity, climate change , human well-being "
"or all of them combined."

"The heat maps can be toggled on and off, to view the heat map of priority "
"areas for GBF implementation, which shows all planning features together "
"(spatial heat map), or the heat maps that show only the planning features "
"within specific themes (biodiversity, climate change , human well-being). "
"Important areas are shown in a range of colors from green to yellow, with "
"those in yellow being the most important."
