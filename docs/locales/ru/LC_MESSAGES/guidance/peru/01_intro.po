"Humanity depends on nature in fundamental ways: for its livelihoods, "
"economies, well-being and ability to mitigate and adapt to climate change. "
"Placing nature at the center of all activities is therefore essential to "
"ensure sustainable societies. The importance of nature has been recognized "
"by the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) with the "
"adoption, in December 2022, of the `Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity "
"Framework <https://www.cbd.int/gbf>`_."

"Spatial data are essential for the implementation of several GBF targets, "
"they will also be essential for countries to monitor and report on progress "
"towards these targets, where `41% of the headline indicators and 34% of the "
"component indicators have a methodology that encourages the use of spatial "
"data <https://unbiodiversitylab.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SP_Guidance-"
"Using-Spatial-Data-to-Support-GBF.pdf>`_. In this regard, `GBF Target 3 "
"<https://www.cbd.int/gbf/targets/3>`_, also known as the 30x30 Target aims "
"to conserve 30% of terrestrial areas, inland waters and seas by 2030. In "
"addition to this high-level quantitative goal, the target includes "
"qualitative elements, such as \"ecologically representative, well-connected "
"and equitably governed\" systems. The target also mentions various "
"conservation approaches, including protected areas and other effective area-"
"based conservation measures (OECM), as well as recognition and respect for "
"the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities. For this target, the "
"use of geospatial data is extremely relevant for identifying conservation "
"areas, as well as for monitoring and reporting on the impacts of various "
"types of conservation schemes."

"UNDP, through a partnership with Peru and the United Nations Environment "
"Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC), implemented the "
"Prioritizing Nature project to support the national use of spatial data to "
"achieve GBF Target 3 and the equivalent target at the national level. The "
"project built on previous collaborations using innovative tools such as the "
"`UN Biodiversity Lab <https://unbiodiversitylab.org/>`_ (UNBL) and effective "
"methodologies such as the `Maps of Hope <http://www.mapsofhope.org/>`_ in "
"which countries identify ELSAs where nature protection, management and "
"restoration measures can best contribute to the achievement of various "
"national priority policy objectives in biodiversity, climate and sustainable "
"development."

"The project mobilized key national stakeholders and experts to carry out a "
"series of scientific activities to develop an ELSA map that supports the "
"goals of the GBF and the ENDB. In Peru, work was carried out with national "
"partners, in particular the Ministry of Environment (MINAM), to support the "
"country to identify and assess potential conservation areas based on "
"existing land governance and management, improve network connectivity and "
"support the achievement of national environmental and socioeconomic "
"priorities; this led to supporting the government to propose forms of "
"protection to meet the 30x30 Target in Peru."

"To develop the ELSA map, Systematic Conservation Planning (SCP) was used to "
"analyze land use zones and outcomes. SCP is used to optimize spatially "
"explicit conservation actions to promote the persistence of biodiversity and "
"other natural features in situ. SCP involves a transparent and objective "
"process of setting clear goals and objectives, and then planning "
"conservation actions that meet them. The  ELSA mapping process was developed "
"to directly support the spatial elements of the GBF and the ENDB targets. "
"This includes Goals 1-3, which set goals around spatial planning, "
"sustainable management, ecosystem restoration, and protection through "
"protected areas and OECMs. Other spatial elements were also drawn from GBF "
"Targets 4-12, which cover threatened species, climate change and a range of "
"ecosystem services."
