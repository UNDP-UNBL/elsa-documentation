"The ELSA Tool enables diverse stakeholders to collaboratively assess "
"national priorities for the KMGBF, explore trade-offs and synergies, and "
"develop spatial plans to support national implementation of Targets 1, 2, "
"and 3. The ELSA Tool produces spatial prioritization maps that identify "
"areas for protection, restoration, management, and urban greening that will "
"have the highest impact towards achieving KMGBF Targets 1-12.  Users with a "
"`UNBL workspace <https://unbiodiversitylab.org/en/unbl-workspaces/>`_ can "
"use the ELSA Tool to execute a customized national spatial prioritization as "
"part of a participatory spatial planning process. They can:"

"Create and execute new ELSA analysis runs with different stakeholder groups. "
"Users can modify and edit ELSA analysis runs in the following ways: - Modify "
"the percentage of national territory allocated for each nature-based action "
"zone including protection (KMGBF Target 3), restoration (KMGBF Target 2), "
"management (KMGBF Target 10), and/or urban greening (KMGBF Target 12). These "
"configurations can be adapted to the country's policy targets for "
"conservation, restoration, and protection, among others; - Choose whether to "
"lock-in existing Protected Areas for protection, ensuring existing Protected "
"Areas are selected within the solution map; - Edit weights of each of the "
"input layers (planning features) based on national importance of the mapped "
"feature and confidence in the input data; and - Edit the boundary penalty "
"factor parameter to adjust spatial cohesion of the action map."

"The ELSA Tool uses the *prioritizr* package in the back end as a spatial "
"optimization tool to run an ELSA analysis. *prioritizr* supports a broad "
"range of objectives, constraints and penalties to create a tailored "
"analysis. Optimizations can be executed quickly on UNBL (often within 3-5 "
"minutes). It can therefore be used to generate and refine conservation plans "
"in real-time during stakeholder meetings, and contribute to a more "
"transparent, inclusive, and participatory decision-making process to "
"identify priority areas to support the implementation of KMGBF Targets 1, 2 "
