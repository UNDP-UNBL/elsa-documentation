"One outcome of the ELSA analysis is to identify synergies among actions for "
"KMGBF Targets that span biodiversity, climate change and human well-being. "
"The analysis measures the outcome of each planning feature with a "
"representation score to show where planning for all KMGBF targets "
"simultaneously might have led to specific planning features being "
