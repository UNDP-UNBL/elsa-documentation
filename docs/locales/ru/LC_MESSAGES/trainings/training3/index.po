"Most software tools for conservation planning (e.g. `Marxan <https://"
"marxansolutions.org/>`_ or `Zonation <https://zonationteam.github.io/"
"Zonation5/>`_) do not require any specific coding skills, and only require "
"basic GIS capabilities to correctly extract and prepare input data. However, "
"`prioritizr <https://prioritizr.net/>`_, the tool that runs behind the "
"scenes in the *Prioritizing Nature Webtools* (that we will be using today) "
"is written in *R* and having a basic understanding of the *R* programming "
"language will help with both small-scale troubleshooting and provide a "
"better understanding of the inner workings of the *Prioritizing Nature "
"Webtools* tools. On top of that, understanding how *R* (or any computer "
"language you work with) operates allows for creating fast and reproducible "
"workflows by exploiting the advantages of the programming language. It also "
"allows for pre- and post-processing of your data, all in *R*."

"The first step to all this (of course) is to install *R*. We will also "
"install several other useful and required software programs (or libraries), "
"such as *RStudio*, that either are requirements for using *prioritizr* or "
"will simply make our lives a little bit easier."

"Even if you already have *R*, *RStudio*, and some of the required packages "
"installed, we recommend making sure that all of these are updated regularly "
"and on the latest version. Some of the material provided here might throw "
"errors if old software versions are used."
