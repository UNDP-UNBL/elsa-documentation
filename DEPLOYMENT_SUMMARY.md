# Deployment Summary - GitHub Pages

## ✅ Configuration Complete

Your ELSA documentation is now configured to automatically deploy to **GitHub Pages** (not ReadTheDocs).

## 🎯 What Changed

### Removed
- `.readthedocs.yaml` → Renamed to `.readthedocs.yaml.disabled`
- No more dependency on ReadTheDocs service

### Added
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` → GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment
- `GITHUB_PAGES_SETUP.md` → Complete setup guide

### Updated
- `mkdocs.yml` → Changed `site_url` to GitHub Pages URL
- `QUICKSTART.md` → Updated deployment instructions

## 🚀 Deployment Flow

```
1. You push to main branch
      ↓
2. GitHub Action triggers automatically
      ↓
3. Installs Python 3.11 + dependencies
      ↓
4. Runs: mkdocs gh-deploy
      ↓
5. Builds all 5 language versions
      ↓
6. Pushes to gh-pages branch
      ↓
7. GitHub Pages serves the site
      ↓
8. Live in 2-3 minutes! 🎉
```

## 🌐 Your Site URLs

After setup, your documentation will be available at:

- **Main site**: https://undp-unbl.github.io/elsa-documentation/
- **Spanish**: https://undp-unbl.github.io/elsa-documentation/es/
- **French**: https://undp-unbl.github.io/elsa-documentation/fr/
- **Portuguese**: https://undp-unbl.github.io/elsa-documentation/pt/
- **Russian**: https://undp-unbl.github.io/elsa-documentation/ru/

## 📋 Setup Checklist

Before pushing to GitHub, you need to enable GitHub Pages:

- [ ] Go to repository Settings → Pages
- [ ] Set Source to: "Deploy from a branch"
- [ ] Set Branch to: `gh-pages` / `(root)`
- [ ] Click Save

That's it! The `gh-pages` branch will be created automatically on first deployment.

## 🔄 First Deployment

To deploy for the first time:

```bash
# Make sure you're on the main branch
git checkout main

# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit with a message
git commit -m "Configure GitHub Pages deployment"

# Push to main
git push origin main
```

Then:
1. Go to: https://github.com/UNDP-UNBL/elsa-documentation/actions
2. Watch the "Deploy MkDocs to GitHub Pages" action run
3. Wait for green checkmark (2-3 minutes)
4. Visit your site!

## 🛠️ How It Works

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file:
- Triggers on every push to `main` branch
- Can also be triggered manually from Actions tab
- Uses Python 3.11 (same as your local setup)
- Installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- Runs `mkdocs gh-deploy` command
- Deploys to `gh-pages` branch automatically

### MkDocs gh-deploy Command

This command:
- Builds the site to a temporary directory
- Creates/updates the `gh-pages` branch
- Commits the built site to `gh-pages`
- Pushes to GitHub
- GitHub Pages serves from `gh-pages` branch

### No Manual Steps Required

Once set up:
1. Edit `.md` files in `docs/`
2. Commit and push to `main`
3. Site updates automatically!

## 📊 Monitoring

### Check Build Status

**GitHub Actions Tab**: https://github.com/UNDP-UNBL/elsa-documentation/actions

You'll see:
- ✅ Green checkmark = Successful deployment
- ⏳ Orange circle = Building now
- ❌ Red X = Build failed (check logs)

### View Deployment History

Each commit to `main` creates a new deployment.
View history in the Actions tab.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
1. Check Actions tab for error logs
2. Verify all files committed
3. Test locally: `mkdocs build`
4. Check `requirements.txt` is committed

### Site Not Updating
1. Check Actions shows green checkmark
2. Wait 2-3 minutes after deployment
3. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
4. Check you're on the right URL

### 404 Error
1. Verify GitHub Pages is enabled (Settings → Pages)
2. Verify branch set to `gh-pages`
3. Wait for first deployment to complete

### Images Not Loading
- All images in `docs/` are included automatically
- Use relative paths in markdown
- Test locally with `mkdocs serve`

## 💡 Tips

### Preview Before Deploying

Always test locally first:
```bash
mkdocs serve
```

### Manual Deployment

You can deploy manually if needed:
```bash
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

### Check What Will Deploy

See what will be built:
```bash
mkdocs build
ls -la site/
```
